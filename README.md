# MinimumSpanningTreeAlgorithmImplementation
This project is implementing 2 classic Algorithms to find MST.
1. Prim Algorithm
2. Kruskal's Algorithm
3. Boruvka Algorithm

It has all the Java file for above 3 algorithms and to run this just download the code in eclipse and run that as java application.
File name:
1. BoruvkaMSTAlgoImplemenation.java
2. PrimMSTAlgoImplementation.java
3. kruskalsMSTAlgoImplemenation.java
4. new.txt - This is the input file for all the algorithms.
